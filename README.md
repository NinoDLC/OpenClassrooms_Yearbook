## What is it ?
At first glance, this is just a [Yearbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yearbook) for OpenClassrooms' Android students. Gotta feel proud of these years spent studying!

But there's more:
* This is **your time to shine**! Show your best Android skills to present yourself! **Fork the project**, iterate on it, and create a **Pull Request**!
* This is maybe the first time you iterate on a Github repository you didn't create. Here's the opportunity to be **part of an open source project**!
* Finally, the main goal is to make you experience your (maybe) first **[git conflict resolution](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)** and **[code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)**! This may be scary, but it is better to experiment it here rather that in your first day at work, isn't it ? :)

## Rules
There's no rules, to be honest. Simply, **respect other people's work**, but besides that, you're free to do whatever you want to present yourself! If you feel the previous work isn't enough, **feel free to enhance it**! Don't worry, no hard feelings for removing old code in order to improve it in the open source world. 

Be **creative**, try to do something **new**! At least, create a new `Card` to present yourself or something like that. It's up to you. Don't hesitate to think outside the box or "break" some previous stuff. Meanwhile, don't feel pressed to make something incredible, the goal is to learn how to work in a team using Git, after all. A simple `XML` change with your name in a `Card` will be enough for me to make you experience a Git conflict, *hehe*. 

PS: you don't have to put a photo of yourself, naturally. I just like doing silly faces. 

For bonus (meaningless) points, you can also: 
* Use a RecyclerView + (GridLayoutManager or StaggeredLayoutManager) instead of manually editing the layout files to add yourself
* Make the application shine in tablet (currently, that's quite a bad experience)
* Add a CI to perform some checks after a PR
* Add a search function for skills, maybe get rid of tabs and merge Kotlin and Java tabs together since you can search by skills ?
* Create new skills badges !
* Add transitions (SharedElementTransition), animations (MotionLayout, AnimatedVectorDrawable, Lottie), custom views (bars, graphs, canvas), etc! 
* Add an "About" section in a drawer layout
* Migrate some views to Compose
* Add traductions for a language
* Support a11y better (try the app with a higher user font size)
* Anything that comes to mind to improve the app or make it prettier, make the code more readable, more robust, etc. This app is yours, truely ! :)
